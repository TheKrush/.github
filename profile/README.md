### 🧠 What I Build

I live in the overlap between:

- **Automation & DevOps** – GitHub Actions, sync tooling, and scripts that keep a small empire of repos aligned.
- **Bots & Tools** – Discord bots, stock scanners, calendar tools, and whatever else seems useful (or chaotic) at the time.
- **Worlds & Lore** – D&D multiverses, campaign tooling, and narrative systems that blur the line between code and story.

If there’s a pattern, it’s this:

> Build once, wire it everywhere, and make it easy to grow later.

### 🕸 GitHub Ecosystem

I organize work across a few focused GitHub orgs:

| Org | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| 🧩 **LostMinions** | Brand, bots, tools, and 3D designs. General automation playground. |
| 🎮 **LostMinionsGames** | Game prototypes, Unreal Engine experiments, shared gameplay systems. |
| 🌌 **ThePortalRealm** | D&D multiverse, lore, calendars, and campaign tooling. |

This account (`TheKrush`) also hosts experiments, shared infrastructure, and utilities that support the ecosystem.

### 🎮 & 📚 Stuff I Care About

You’ll see a lot of:

- **Discord bots** (stock, utility, and narrative-driven)
- **.NET / C#** libraries for shared systems
- **Unreal Engine** experiments and gameplay prototypes
- **TTRPG tooling** for long-running campaigns and weird settings

Some projects are polished. Some are prototypes. All of them are part of figuring out the next thing.
