### 🧠 What I Build

I live in the overlap between:

- **Automation & DevOps** – GitHub Actions, sync hubs, and scripts that keep a small empire of repos aligned.
- **Bots & Tools** – Discord bots, stock scanners, calendar tools, and whatever else seems useful (or chaotic) at the time.
- **Worlds & Lore** – D&D multiverses, campaign tooling, and narrative systems that blur the line between code and story.

If there’s a pattern, it’s this:

> Build once, wire it everywhere, and make it easy to grow later.

### 🕸 GitHub Ecosystem

I organize work across a few focused GitHub orgs:

| Org | Focus |
|-----|-------|
| 🧩 **LostMinions** | Brand, bots, tools, and 3D designs. General automation playground. |
| 🎮 **LostMinionsGames** | Game prototypes, Unreal Engine experiments, shared gameplay systems. |
| 🌌 **ThePortalRealm** | D&D multiverse, lore, calendars, and campaign tooling. |

This account (`TheKrush`) also hosts:

- Personal experiments
- Shared infrastructure
- The **super admin hub** (`TheKrush/.github`) that pushes workflows, scripts, and standards out to those orgs and selected private repos.

### 🔧 Super Admin Hub

`TheKrush/.github` is my control plane:

- Central **workflows** and **composite actions**
- A shared **/admin** sync engine
- Repo lists and manifests that keep multiple orgs in sync

Changes there can fan out across dozens of repos, so it’s mostly infrastructure, not feature work.

### 🎮 & 📚 Stuff I Care About

You’ll see a lot of:

- **Discord bots** (stock, utility, and narrative-driven)
- **.NET / C#** libraries for shared systems
- **Unreal Engine** experiments and gameplay prototypes
- **TTRPG tooling** for long-running campaigns and weird settings

Some projects are polished. Some are prototypes. All of them are part of figuring out the next thing.

### 💬 Elsewhere

Most of the public-facing links, communities, and socials live under the **Lost Minions** banner:

- 🌲 [Link hub](https://lostminions.org/links)

From there you can find Discord, socials, shops, and more.
